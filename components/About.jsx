        Hey there!
        <br />
        <br />
        My name is <span className="p">Tom Sanders</span>, and I'm a <span className="o">front-end developer</span>. Thanks for stopping by!
        <br />
        <br />
        I'm originally from the US, but have been living in Japan for the last 7 years. <span className="b">I'm headed to England early in 2023!</span> Super excited!
        <br />
        <br />
        I'm passionate about building <span className="r">simple</span>, <span className="r">clean</span>, <span className="r">interesting</span> user experiences. Recently, I've been learning about accessibility best-practices. When I'm not mainlining coffee and writing code, you can find me exploring with my wife, reading a good book, or playing games.

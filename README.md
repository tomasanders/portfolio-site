# Portfolio Site

I created this as a way to show some different things I think are neat, and more importantly, as a way to improve my knowledge of React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS.

This site was written entirely in React and Tailwind CSS (albeit with some custom CSS classes here and there).

## Concept

I was aiming to sort of recreate the experience of looking at code in an IDE as a fun way to showcase my projects, and to break away from the normal portfolio site style.

### Home

The home page is a fun play on creating a class in JavaScript, and myself as an instance of that class. I used `<pre>` tags to preserve the indentation I needed, to recreate that IDE feel. Using the `this.resume` to display my HTML resume is a fun thing as well. Presenting the other site pages in a console-type window was a fun touch as well.

#### About

Pretty simple here - just a blurb about myself.

#### Projects

I thought showing my projects with just the essential data as a JavaScript Object would be fun, while still giving all the relevant information.

#### Contact

Pretty standard contact form. I tried to make it look like terminal commands (not sure how well that went!).

#### Resume

This was a break in the format, as I wanted the resume to be printer-friendly.

##### Additional Challenges

The main challenge I had was that I had this concept of what I wanted the site to look like, but I also wanted to make sure it was WCAG compliant. I used the WAVE Chrome extension to check for any issues and fixed them as I came across them.
